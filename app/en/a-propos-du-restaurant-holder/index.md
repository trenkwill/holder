As the years go by, this big European style brasserie is becoming a Montreal institution. Be it lunch, brunch or dinner, the Holder is always buzzing with activity. Designed by the late Luc Laporte, one of this city’s most reputable architects, this large and airy space looks and feels like it’s always been around. The high ceilings, the tall windows, the bar walls stocked with hundreds of bottles, all contribute to making this place remarkable and one of the busiest restaurants in town. The menu offers something for every taste, from classic bistro fare to more contemporary dishes created by chef Simon Laplante. To top it off, the service is done by a wonderful team of people who enjoy their work, and will insure that you have a great time. Holder is dynamic, noisy (it must be said!), and a lot of fun at a reasonable price…
